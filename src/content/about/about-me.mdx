My name is Miljan, I'm a web developer and I'm very passionate about building things on the web, especially with React & NextJS.

I had my first contact with programming and Web development when I was very young. From the moment I got my first computer when I was 6 years old, I fell in love with technology and began to explore it more deeply. The inquisitive spirit that I carry within me has always encouraged me to explore and study new things and technologies.

When I was 13 years old I started creating forums using phpBB3, SMF and vBulletin. I've been creating my own mods and scripts for the games I played. I could spend days and nights working on these things and searching through Internet to find solutions to problems that I encountereted. Then I realized that I just enjoyed it.

Fast-forward to 2022 and I became a web developer. I like to build fullstack applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next JS, Tailwind and TypeScript.

With a strong foundation in modern web development technologies and a keen eye for details, I strive to create solid web applications that captivate users and drive results.

Currently I'm looking for new opportunities, so feel free to say hello!
