My name is Miljan, I'm a web developer, occasional YouTube content creator and React & JavaScript enthusiast.

I had my first contact with programming and Web development when I was very young. From the moment I got my first computer when I was 6 years old, I fell in love with technology and began to explore it more deeply. The inquisitive spirit that I carry within me has always encouraged me to explore and study new things and technologies.

When I was 13 years old I started creating forums using phpBB3, SMF and vBulletin. I've been creating my own mods and scripts for the games I played. I could spend days and nights working on these things and searching through Internet to find solutions to problems that I encountereted. Then I realized that I just enjoyed it.

Fast-forward to 2022 and I began to seriously focus on improving my Web development skills. I have learned to use technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next JS, Tailwind, TypeScript, Redux, Git and Sass.

I completed several courses on Udemy, among them the HTML & CSS and JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann, as well as the React course by Maximilian Shawrzmuller. Now I'm workign as a freelance Web developer but I'm also looking for new opportunities, so feel free to click that button below and let's talk!
