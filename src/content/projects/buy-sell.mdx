Buy&Sell is an e-commerce application, akin to a customer-to-customer (C2C) or business-to-customer (B2C) platform, inspired by platforms like eBay. The primary purpose of this application is to provide users with a feature-rich online marketplace where they can create accounts, list items for sale, purchase items, rate other users, engage in messaging, and enjoy various other functionalities.

## Technology Stack and Rationale:

The technology stack employed in Buy&Sell encompasses NextJS, Tailwind, TypeScript, Prisma, and MongoDB. Each component was carefully selected to optimize the development process and enhance the application's capabilities.

NextJS, a versatile and efficient framework, enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG) and provides excellent performance. Its seamless integration with React facilitates dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, empowers developers to create visually appealing and consistent designs with ease, reducing development time and effort. The adoption of TypeScript enhances code maintainability, improves error detection, and promotes scalability.

MongoDB, a leading NoSQL database, offers a highly flexible and scalable solution for managing large volumes of data. Its document-oriented structure and dynamic schema facilitate seamless integration with the application, accommodating evolving data needs and simplifying complex data queries.

Prisma, a modern database toolkit, serves as an interface between the application and MongoDB, providing an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer that streamlines database operations and enhances data modeling capabilities. Together, MongoDB and Prisma offer a robust and efficient data management solution, optimizing performance and facilitating seamless scalability.

## Challenges Encountered

The development of Buy&Sell presented a range of challenges, some of which pertained to database management. The flexibility offered by MongoDB, while advantageous in many aspects, required careful consideration to ensure proper data modeling and efficient query execution.

I devoted time to designing a well-structured database schema that optimized data retrieval and storage, balancing the demands of complex data relationships with the need for performance and scalability.
