DealHub is a comprehensive e-commerce application, serving as a customer-to-customer (C2C) or business-to-customer (B2C) platform akin to popular platforms like eBay. The main objective of this application is to provide users with a robust online marketplace where they can create accounts, list items for sale, purchase products, rate other users, engage in messaging, and explore a wide range of features.

## Technology Stack and Rationale:

The technology stack implemented in DealHub comprises NextJS, Tailwind, TypeScript, Prisma, and PlanetScale. Each component was carefully selected to optimize the development process and enhance the capabilities of the application.

NextJS, a versatile and efficient framework, facilitates server-side rendering (SSR) and provides excellent performance. Its seamless integration with React enables the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, empowers developers to create visually appealing and consistent designs efficiently, reducing development time and effort. The adoption of TypeScript enhances code maintainability, improves error detection, and promotes scalability.

PlanetScale, a scalable relational database platform, is utilized as the primary database for DealHub. PlanetScale's innovative approach to distributed databases ensures seamless scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance. Its compatibility with Prisma, a modern database toolkit and ORM, enables efficient data modeling, query execution, and management. Together, PlanetScale and Prisma offer a robust and reliable data storage solution.

## Challenges Encountered

The development of DealHub presented several challenges, particularly during the integration of PlanetScale as the new database solution. Migrating from MongoDB to PlanetScale required careful consideration of data modeling and ensuring a smooth transition of existing data.

Additionally, adapting the application to leverage the features and capabilities of PlanetScale introduced complexities in handling data relationships and complex queries. Despite these challenges, the development of DealHub persevered, resulting in an advanced and user-friendly e-commerce platform.
